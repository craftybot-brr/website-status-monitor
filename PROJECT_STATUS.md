# PROJECT STATUS: Azure & EC2 Endpoint Monitoring Dashboard

## What Has Been Done

- **Azure Monitoring Feature:**
  - Implemented `/azure` dashboard and backend logic for Azure Storage endpoint monitoring.
  - Added `check_azure_connectivity` and `update_azure_status_data` functions.
  - Created `/api/azure/status` endpoint for frontend data.
  - Added Azure dashboard link to homepage navigation.

- **EC2 Monitoring:**
  - Existing EC2 dashboard and backend logic for AWS endpoint monitoring.

- **Refactoring & Structure:**
  - Moved all endpoint definitions (`EC2_ENDPOINTS`, `AZURE_ENDPOINTS`) to a new `endpoints.py` file for modularity.
  - `app.py` now imports endpoint configs from `endpoints.py`.
  - All status update logic runs in background threads for real-time data.

- **Frontend:**
  - `azure.html` and `ec2.html` dashboards styled and functional.
  - Homepage (`index.html`) navigation updated.

## What Still Needs To Be Done

- **Documentation:**
  - Update `README.md` to describe the new Azure dashboard and API endpoints.

- **Testing:**
  - Test `/azure` dashboard and `/api/azure/status` for all regions.
  - Confirm all endpoints in `endpoints.py` are correct and complete.

- **Enhancements (Optional):**
  - Add more Azure service types or endpoints if needed.
  - Add alerting, notifications, or historical analytics.
  - Improve error handling/logging for unreachable endpoints.
