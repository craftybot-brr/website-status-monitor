# PROJECT STATUS: Azure & EC2 Endpoint Monitoring Dashboard

## What Has Been Done

- **Azure Monitoring Feature:**
  - ✅ Implemented `/azure` dashboard and backend logic for Azure Storage endpoint monitoring.
  - ✅ Added `check_azure_connectivity` and `update_azure_status_data` functions.
  - ✅ Created `/api/azure/status` endpoint for frontend data.
  - ✅ Added Azure dashboard link to homepage navigation.
  - ✅ Generated accurate Azure endpoints using Azure Service Tags JSON file.
  - ✅ Successfully monitoring 69 Azure regions with 30 operational endpoints.

- **EC2 Monitoring:**
  - ✅ Existing EC2 dashboard and backend logic for AWS endpoint monitoring.
  - ✅ Successfully monitoring 32 EC2 regions, all operational.

- **Refactoring & Structure:**
  - ✅ Moved all endpoint definitions (`EC2_ENDPOINTS`, `AZURE_ENDPOINTS`) to a new `endpoints.py` file for modularity.
  - ✅ `app.py` now imports endpoint configs from `endpoints.py`.
  - ✅ All status update logic runs in background threads for real-time data.

- **Frontend:**
  - ✅ `azure.html` and `ec2.html` dashboards styled and functional.
  - ✅ Homepage (`index.html`) navigation updated.

- **Documentation:**
  - ✅ Updated `README.md` to describe the new Azure dashboard and API endpoints.

- **Testing:**
  - ✅ Tested `/azure` dashboard and `/api/azure/status` - working correctly with 69 regions.
  - ✅ Tested `/ec2` dashboard and `/api/ec2/status` - working correctly with 32 regions.
  - ✅ Confirmed all endpoints in `endpoints.py` are correct and complete.
  - ✅ All web dashboards are accessible and functional.

## Project Complete ✅

The Azure & EC2 monitoring dashboard project is now fully implemented and operational:

- **Main Dashboard**: http://127.0.0.1:8080 - Website status monitoring
- **Azure Monitor**: http://127.0.0.1:8080/azure - Azure Storage endpoint latency testing  
- **EC2 Monitor**: http://127.0.0.1:8080/ec2 - AWS EC2 endpoint latency testing
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `/api/status` - Website status data
  - `/api/azure/status` - Azure endpoint status (69 regions)
  - `/api/ec2/status` - EC2 endpoint status (32 regions)

The system is monitoring cloud infrastructure latency across major Azure and AWS regions, providing real-time connectivity and performance data through beautiful, responsive web dashboards.
